## FAQ

#### Language and testing?

Testing all manually done, the program was programmed completely in Java. The database was all in text files.

#### How does the program work?

When you run the program it prompts you to choose whelther you're a customer or an operator. After that you choose one of the vending machines that are in the database. Depending on which user type you've chosen the program will prompt you on the actions you can do as that type of user.

The operator will not be allowed to access the machine. Operators can only access machines they are authorized to access.
